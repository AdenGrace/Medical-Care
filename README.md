# Medical-Care
In this project I've used python as my programming language and Excel as my data base.
The idea of this project is to store inserted information from different patients by one doctor, providing easy access to their files if needed and instatnt medical care.
Using detailed information I've collected by proffesionals I've set a few questions that by patients answering them and doctors logging their informations, doctors can get instant potential required care and it's all stored in an excel sheet. 
Patients name, email, id, answers to questions will all be stored in the excel sheet and updated as needed. 
Multiple doctors will have access to their profiles and patients accordingly.
